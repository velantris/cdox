# Generate Cursor Rules

I need to create a new Cursor rule file (.mdc). Help me generate the appropriate rule content.

## What I need:
- **Rule type**: What type of rule do you want to create?
  - `rules.mdc` - Main project rules and guidelines
  - `plan.mdc` - Planning and architecture guidelines
  - `implement.mdc` - Implementation guidelines and patterns
  - `debug.mdc` - Debugging and troubleshooting guidelines
  - `memory.mdc` - Context and memory management
  - `directory-structure.mdc` - Project structure guidelines
  - `custom` - Custom rule file (specify filename)

- **Rule purpose**: What should this rule accomplish? Describe the behavior or guidelines you want to enforce.

- **Target context**: Which Cursor modes should this rule apply to?
  - Chat mode
  - Write mode
  - MCP mode
  - All modes
  - Custom mode (specify name)

- **Specific guidelines**: What specific rules, constraints, or patterns should be included?

## Rule structure:
1. Start with a clear description of what the rule does
2. Include specific instructions and constraints
3. Add examples where helpful
4. Consider edge cases and exceptions
5. Keep it focused and actionable

## Output format:
Generate a complete .mdc file that I can save in `.cursor/rules/` with the appropriate filename. The file should follow Cursor's rule format and be immediately effective.

Make sure the generated rule:
- Uses clear, specific language
- Includes actionable guidelines
- Considers common edge cases
- Is appropriate for the specified mode(s)
- Follows Cursor .mdc file conventions

## Example rule types:
- Code style and formatting rules
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Security guidelines
- Performance constraints
- Architecture patterns
- Commit message standards
