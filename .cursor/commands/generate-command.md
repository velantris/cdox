# Generate Command

I need to create a new custom command for Cursor. Help me generate the Markdown content for this command.

## What I need:
- **Command name**: What should the command be called (this will be the filename)
- **Purpose**: What does this command do? Describe the workflow or task
- **Parameters**: What additional context should users provide when running this command?
- **Steps**: What are the specific steps or instructions this command should contain?

## Command structure:
1. Start with a clear title describing what the command does
2. Provide step-by-step instructions in plain English
3. Include any placeholders for user input (like `{filename}` or `{description}`)
4. Keep it concise but comprehensive

## Output format:
Generate a complete Markdown file that I can save in `.cursor/commands/` with the appropriate filename. The file should follow Cursor's command format and be immediately usable when I type `/command-name` in chat.

Make sure the generated command:
- Has a descriptive filename (kebab-case)
- Contains actionable instructions
- Is reusable for similar tasks
- Follows best practices for Cursor commands
